          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Howdy, I'm Ryan, I've been making cool stuff out of pixels for a
            long time now.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my first computer as a kid, an old Apple IIc, and it was there
            that I developed a love for making things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also a former sailor, I've been completely around the world. My
            first lap was completed before I turned twenty. I spent six years in
            the service and got to see a lot of amazing places and people.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I got out, I got one of those 'real jobs' and blinked as ten
            years went by. Funny how that happens. Anyways, the recession hits
            and while we're all miserable, watching our 401k's plummet, I asked
            myself a simple question.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Why am I doing this?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I loved making things, and by things I don't mean pivot tables.
            (Apologies to any excel-lovers out there.) I took some time to
            reflect about things that I enjoyed doing, and it all came back to
            making stuff on the old computer. So I decided to career change. I
            had all this GI Bill money from the service waiting for me and it
            was time to put it to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then I've worked at a couple of really big companies in
            addition to freelance work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently looking for my next opportunity. If you made it this
            far and would like to{" "}
            <Link href="/resume/">
              <a>check out my resume</a>
            </Link>{" "}
            that'd be great.
