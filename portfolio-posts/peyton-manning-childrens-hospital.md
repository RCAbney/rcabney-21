We recently redesigned the Peyton Manning Children's Hospital website in WordPress. My major contribution to this project was developing a roster component for our provider team pages.

Previously, these pages were hand-coded and had to be manually updated in several places (not just this website) each time a provider's status changed. My solution was to create a component that queried our online provider finder's' API and returned the most updated physician biographies for any given team page.

This ensured that the latest and most correct data was always displayed, and status updates were handled from a single source of truth, instead of two to five different sites/databases.
